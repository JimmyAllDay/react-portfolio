          <p>
            I have been training in Javascript technologies since late 2020. I
            have foundational Javascript and React skills, and I am currently
            rounding these out with training in Angular, Node, Express and Mongo
            DB. Among my various coding interests, I am particularly drawn to
            the concepts of Test Driven Development and Functional Programming,
            for the confidence, maintainability and elegance that these
            approaches offer.
