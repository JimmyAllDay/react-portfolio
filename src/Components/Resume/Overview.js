        I am currently transitioning to a career in web development. Prospective
        employers will see from my{" "}
        <a href="https://github.com/JimmyAllDay?tab=repositories">GitHub</a>{" "}
        repository that I have foundational Javascript programming skills,
        including in the use of vanilla Javascript, HTML, CSS, Sass, Bootstrap,
        Node and React. In May of 2021, I completed a{" "}
        <i>Front End Developer Nano-Degree</i> certificate through Udacity. In
        November 2021, I completed a further nano-degree certificate in React,
        which involved training in Redux. I am currently undertaking another
        Udacity course to round out my learning with knowledge of MEAN and MERN
        stacks, and Test Driven Development. I am attracted to roles where I
        will help realise an entrepreneurial vision, such as roles within
        innovative or start-up companies. Sustained by a sincere passion for web
        development, I often work on projects late into the night. Employers
        will maximise my value by placing me in roles where I can harness this
        work ethic, while learning from more experienced developers.
